# Recreating the twitter website

For this assignment I decided to recreate the twitter webpage.

I choose this as the components were minimal, clear, and easy to distinquish, but not so simple like Instagram where basically the entire site is one component.

I chose to recreate the **_homepage_** and **_notifications_** page as there's lots of resuable items and similar items across the different pages.

I have lots of components in this project including:

## Sidebar
This component exists on the left side of the site, and always the left side, it houses the navigation bar allowing users to switch between pages

## SidebarSelect
This is to make the component reuseable in the sidebar, making it easy put in new items into the sidebar.

## Button
For buttons that need to return an action that isn't required for this project, so there's just an alert popup instead

## Feed
This is where I layout the middle column content page, the feed exists within the **Homepage**

## MakeTweet
This is the box inside of **Feed** for users to create and post a tweet

## Post
This is where the template of the post exists, this also goes inside of **Feed**

## Notifications
Also a middle column content page but for notifications

## Notification Posts
The content template for items within **Notifications** similar to **Post**

## News
The right column content with the _"search bar"_, _"what's happening"_, _"who to follow"_, as well as the _"footer"_

## FollowUser
Component that goes into **News** specifically for the "Who to follow" section
